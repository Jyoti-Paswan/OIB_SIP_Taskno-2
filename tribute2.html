        <ul><li>Swami Vivekananda’s birth anniversary is declared as National Youth Day. 
        The original youth icon. Somebody who continues to inspire generations. 
        Although there are many things to learn from the lives of great people of 
        the past, rarely do we know how to implement the lessons. To make it easier 
        for you, we have first listed seven wonderful lessons from Swami Vivekananda’s
         life and ways to imbibe them in our own.</li><br>
        <li> He was an Indian Hindu monk,Philosopher,author, religious teacher and chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.</li><br>
        <li>Always stressing the universal and huministic said eo f the Vedas , the oldest 
            sacred text of Hinduism, as well as belief in service rather than dogma, vivekananda attempted 
            to infuse vigour into Hindu thought, placing less emphasis on the prevailing pacifism and presenting Hindu
            Sprituality to the west.</li><br>
            <li>From an early age swami Vivekananda was interested in sprituality an used to perfrom meditations in
                 front of pictures of Gods like- Ram, Sita and Mahavira Hanuman swami Vivekananda was enthralled by monks 
                and ascetics who wandered as a young was naughty and restless and his parents frequently struggled to keep 
                to keep under control.
            </li><br>
            <li>Although Vivekananda was a powerful orator and writer in English and Bengali,He was 
                not a thorough scholar, and most of his published works were compiled from lectures 
                given around the world which were mainly delivered impromptu and with little preparation.
                his main work Raja Yoga, consists of talks he delivered in New York.
